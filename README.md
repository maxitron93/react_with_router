# Simple webpack config for React and Router
I created this as a boilerplate I can use when I want to make a simple app that needs just react and react-router

## How to use
1. clone this repo with ```git clone https://github.com/maxitron93/react_with_router```
2. cd into the directory and run ```npm install```
3. after the install finished, run ```npm run start``` to start the devServer and open the app in the browser
